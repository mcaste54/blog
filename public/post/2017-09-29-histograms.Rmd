```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

It's time to build a histogram on Rstudio! After we download the Lahman, sqldf, and ggplt2 packages, we are going to select a certain column from the Master list to display. Let's do body weight for all the players.
```{r}
query<-"select weight from Master"

result<-sqldf(query)
```

Now we just translate this data into a histogram using this code. "Fill" means the color of the bars and "bins" means the number of bars. And we're  done with the histogram!
```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color="blue",fill="white",bins=50)+
  ggtitle("Body-Weight Distribution for Baseball Players")
```
