```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

This next data vizualization is a time series. For this we are extracting data about Babe Ruth's Homerun totals throughout his career.
```{r}
query<-"select yearID,HR from Batting
where playerID='ruthba01'"

result<-sqldf(query)
```

For this graph we are actually putting two graphs on top of each other: a line graph and a scatterplot. It makes it easier to make sense of the representation of this data.
```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle("Ruth's Homerun Totals Throughout the Years")+
  xlab("year")+
  ylab("homeruns")
```
